# Audio-Analyzer README

## Overview
Welcome to our Python Audio Analyzing Projects Repository! This repository hosts two distinct projects demonstrating audio analysis capabilities in Python. These projects are designed to cater to both beginners and experts, providing a clear and simple foundation for building more complex audio analysis tools.

## Projects

### 1. **Real-Time Audio Waveform Visualization**
   - Streams and visualizes audio data from the microphone in real-time.
   - Utilizes `PyAudio` for audio data capture and `Matplotlib` for visualization.
   - Ideal for understanding basic audio processing and real-time data plotting.

### 2. **Audio Spectrum Analyzer**
   - Captures audio data and computes its Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency analysis.
   - Visualizes both the audio waveform and its frequency spectrum.
   - Employs `PyAudio`, `Numpy`, and `Scipy.fftpack` for processing, along with `Matplotlib` for dual-plot visualizations.
   - Suitable for more advanced audio analysis, including frequency domain analysis.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and navigate to the respective project directories. Each project has its own dependencies, which can be installed via pip:
```bash
pip install pyaudio numpy matplotlib scipy
```
Run the Python scripts to start the audio analysis and visualization.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance these projects or to add new features are highly welcomed. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn or an expert looking to expand, this repository is open for your innovative ideas!
